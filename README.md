# household_power_consumption
Analyzed household electricity consumption (2006–2008) using time series and EDA. Handled missing values, combined date &amp; time, visualized usage patterns, plotted distributions, and explored trends for active power, voltage, and sub-metering to reveal daily and seasonal energy consumption behaviors.
